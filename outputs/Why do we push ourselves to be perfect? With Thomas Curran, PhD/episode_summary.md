## **要約**

In this segment of the podcast, the speaker discusses the detrimental effects of conditional acceptance on the development of perfectionism, particularly in children. They emphasize the importance of providing unconditional approval to children, whether they succeed or face setbacks, to prevent them from associating their worth solely with achievements. Normalizing mistakes, failures, and setbacks is also highlighted as a way to teach young people that these experiences are a natural part of life. The speaker encourages parents to openly share their own challenges to set an example for their children. Additionally, societal changes are suggested as a means to alleviate the rise of perfectionism, such as expanding access to higher education and implementing universal basic income to reduce pressure on individuals. Listening to this episode can provide valuable insights for parents and individuals interested in addressing perfectionism in themselves or others.

## **文字起こし**

Have you ever done a job interview where you're asked, what's your biggest weakness? And did you answer, oh, I'm such a perfectionist? There's a good reason this answer has become a job interview cliche. Perfection, after all, is usually seen as a selling point, an asset disguised as a flaw. Who wouldn't want to hire a perfect employee, after all? But psychologist research suggests that perfectionism may not be something to aspire to at all. In recent years, researchers have found rising rates of perfectionism in the United States and around the world, and they've begun to recognize the toll that the drive to be perfect can take on people's mental health and well-being. So why do more and more of us feel the need to push ourselves to perfection? Does our achievement culture demand it? Is it social media and the endless comparisons that come with it? And what does it mean to be a perfectionist anyway? How is perfectionism different from just striving for excellence? And what can we do as individuals, as parents, as a society to help ourselves and each other recognize that often, good is good enough? Welcome to Speaking of Psychology, the flagship podcast of the American Psychological Association that examines the links between psychological science and everyday life. I'm Kim Mills. My guest today is Dr. Thomas Curran, an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychological and Behavioral Science at the London School of Economics. He's a leading expert on perfectionism and how perfectionism is increasing in the modern world. His popular TED Talk on perfectionism has been viewed more than 3 million times, and his research has been covered by news outlets, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR, and CNN.com. His debut book is The Perfection Trap, Embracing the Power of Good Enough. Dr. Curran, thank you for joining me today. Pleasure to be speaking with you, Kim. Back in 2019, you published a study that found rising rates of perfectionism in young people in the US, Canada, and the UK over the past several decades. Tell us about that work. What kind of data did you look at? What did you find? Yeah, that was the, I suppose, my biggest paper I've ever published. And I didn't realise at the time that it was going to be quite the story it was. It was really a hunch. Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest ideas. I just had a hunch of seeing young people in my office. I'm a professor, so I work with young people a lot. It became evident to me over the recent years that there was a lot of pressure that young people are putting on themselves. They were feeling that they weren't good enough, or that no matter how hard they tried, they weren't achieving in the ways in which they were hoping to achieve. I was seeing a lot of requests for not just academic support, but also mental health support as well. All of this seemed to be bound up in this idea of self-imposed pressure. One of the things I decided to do was to try to understand if there is a trend here. If something's happening, something in the water around young people, whether we can maybe detect any of those changes in levels of perfectionism. That was the hunch. I collected all the possible information I could possibly collect on levels of perfectionism in college students from the US, UK, Canada, starting in around 1989, so late 80s, all the way through to around 2021, 2022. Because college students have broadly similar characteristics, which is, by the way, a terrible thing for sampling generally in psychology, but it does happen to have an advantage when it comes to comparing across generations because they're broadly similar to make reliable comparisons. If you string them out over time, you see rising levels of perfectionism among young people. That hunch was confirmed in the data. Those rises were quite steep, particularly for what's called socially prescribed perfectionism, which is a sense that other people and everyone around me expects you to be perfect. That was rising exponentially at a rate of about 33% increase since the late 80s. So, yeah, some really interesting and challenging findings. That propelled me, I suppose, into the TED talk sphere and writing a book and all the rest of it because people really wanted to know about this phenomenon. Masons Well, how do researchers measure perfectionism? Was there some kind of scale that you used, or did you have to create one? Steele Luckily, there is a scale that most researchers use when they study perfectionism. It's called the multi-dimensional perfectionism scale. It was developed by two psychologists, Paul Hewitt, Canadian psychologist Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flatt. I think Gordon Flatt's been on the podcast previously. Incredible scholars did a lot of heavy lifting in this area, developed the scale, and that's what we've been using across the years. That's amazing because we've got one consistent tool there. It's a paper and pencil questionnaire that measures socially prescribed perfectionism, as I mentioned, but also something called self-oriented perfectionism, which is perfectionism that comes from within high self-standards and excessive self-standards. Students have responded to this same survey now for about 30, 35 years, so that gives us a treasure trove of data to do these cohort analyses. That's what we've used to derive our conclusions from. Mason What are a couple of the questions, just so our listeners can understand what you ask people, that indicates that, yeah, you're a perfectionist? Steele Self-oriented perfectionism is a form of perfectionism that comes from inside of us. It's high self-set goals and expectations. We might use an item like, I expect myself to be perfect, or everything I do has to be perfect. We might measure that on a one to five Likert scale. If you don't really agree with that statement, then you might say, I don't agree with that statement, so it might be a one. If you really agree with that statement and strongly agree, you would put a five and everywhere in between. These perfectionist constructs really operate on a spectrum, so higher or lower. Most people are in the middle. That middle bit is increasing over time, as we saw in our data. Socially prescribed perfectionism is another form of perfectionism that we measure. That's really rooted in pressures from the outside world. Other people expect me to be perfect. My parents expect me to be perfect, for example. Those are the sorts of things we might ask and measure.Again, same principle. If you disagree, it's a 1. If you agree, it's a 5 and everywhere in between. Once you aggregate those two items, get an average, you can get a reasonably good idea of where you sit on the spectrum. Now, you've talked about different kinds of perfectionism. You said self-oriented, there's other oriented, and socially prescribed. Have all of these been increasing? Yes. It's important to bear in mind that when it comes to self-oriented perfectionism, that started from a high baseline. In the late 80s, it was already quite high. It's a five point Likert scale. It was around four, the mean scores across many, many samples of college students. That already started high. It went even higher over time. But what was really interesting is not necessarily the self-oriented perfectionism, although that was an interesting finding, but what was going on with socially prescribed is really interesting because that didn't start very high. That started around three, so around the midpoint scale. Most people said, yeah, kind of, kind of not to those items. However, we're seeing that now sharply accelerated. We've updated our 2009 paper with new data, and we're seeing a sharp acceleration in recent years for socially prescribed pressures. That's really worrying because it's those social pressures that most concern us when it comes to things like mental health. They're the strongest link with depression, anxiety, worry, rumination. That's why it concerns us because what we used to see perhaps in the past was high strivings or high self-oriented perfectionism, but at moderate levels of socially prescribed perfectionism. But now what we're seeing is a slightly different pattern in recent generations, where you've got high self-oriented perfectionism, but fast accelerating socially prescribed perfectionism. What do you think is driving these increases? I mean, what's changed in our society in the last couple of decades that would lead to this rise in perfectionism? That's a whole bucket in and of itself. I mean, first of all, it's not a causal analysis. So essentially anything I say here would be speculative, but nevertheless, we can say with reasonable confidence that there are a number of factors, and one of which we have empirically tested. So one of the things we think is happening is parental behaviors are changing. The way in which we rear children is changing. There's a lot more pressure, a lot more surveillance, a lot more monitoring of young people for good reason, and also a lot more expectation as well has been placed on young people, particularly in the academic sphere. There's a lot of evidence to support those claims. We've shown empirically that young people are perceiving that their parents are demanding more of them, particularly in the academic realm. Those higher demands, those higher expectations are highly correlated with perfectionism. So you put those two things together and you begin to see that changing parental practices towards more expectant and controlling forms of rearing have a direct correlation with perfectionism. That may be one of the reasons why perfectionism is rising among young people. But there are factors way beyond parents. It's also important to recognize that this isn't something the parents are doing intentionally. They're just responding to pressures in the outside world. I mean, Ivy League acceptance rates are around 5% today. They were 10% in 2014. That is an incredible amount of pressure that parents see, they feel, and they're going to naturally translate that to their kids in terms of higher academic expectations, because they know it's even harder to get into the elite colleges. Elite college education is really important if you want to get into the elite professions. So parents are just responding to wider pressures that are going on in the wider environment. That isn't just in schools and colleges when it comes to standardised testing and more stringent entry criteria. It's also the broader economy. We've slowed down and that means less opportunities for young people, particularly in the workplace. It's an added pressure that young people feel and that also parents feel. So again, that ratchets up the pressure. There, of course, are other factors. Social media among them has come on the scene in the last 10 years. It certainly hasn't helped when it's come to those social pressures and those idealised images of how we should be looking and appearing and behaving. There's so many factors that we could point to, but in our work and in our theorising, those are the main ones. Taylor Levy Now, your study looked at perfectionism in college students, but is it also increasing in other age groups? You talked about parents kind of leading the way. Are they themselves perfectionists or are they just foisting this on their kids? Richard Duncan A bit of both. Parental perfectionism is very strongly correlated with child perfectionism. We have to be a bit careful there because disaggregating what is social modelling from genes is a tricky one. We know about 30 to 40% of perfectionism is heritage, so a lot of it is genetic. Beyond that, there will be parent socialisation that is at play. There are many different pathways in which parents can transmit perfectionism to young people through expectations, as I've talked about, but also through something called conditional regard. There's conditionality of approval that can occur within parents that teaches children that they're only worth something when they've achieved or done something well. Conditional regard is a big one. There's also anxious forms of rearing that come into play as well. Children see parents behaving anxiously or fearing failure or treating mistakes and failure as big deals, as big problems. That teaches children themselves that those things are big problems and they want to avoid them. There's all sorts of different pathways through which parenting can impact on perfectionism, but it is also important to remember that it is highly genetic, too. Masons Have you been able to follow college students over time? When they leave school and they go into the workplace, do they continue to have that perfectionism? O'Neill Yes, they do. There's not much life course analysis when it comes to perfectionism, so it's very difficult to say whether this is something that ameliorates or doesn't ameliorate over time. We know neuroticism...Transcribed by https://otter.ai What role do you think that this increase in perfectionism and in the achievement culture is playing in driving the youth mental health crisis? Well, it's not the whole picture, of course. We are very keen to highlight perfectionism as a public health concern. We think that these are trends that are telling us something about the way young people are perceiving themselves, are viewing themselves in relation to other people, the way that they're perceiving the social environment and how demanding it is and what is expected of them. We think these are very salient trends in those respects. Because perfectionism, particularly socially described perfectionism, has such a strong correlation with things like depression, anxiety, self-presentation or concerns and other psychologies. When I say big correlation, I mean for psychology research. Big correlations, we're talking about around 25 percent. It's explained depression and anxiety. That's a lot when it comes to psychology research. Because they share such a large correlation, we do think that perfectionism might be a part of the youth mental health crisis that we're currently seeing. Not the only part, but certainly a part. When we think about stereotypes of achievement culture, like the pressure to get perfect grades and in the U.S. these high SAT scores to get into college or participating in the right extracurricular activities, it feels like something that applies mostly to the top end of the socioeconomic ladder. Is that correct or is this tendency cutting across the socioeconomic spectrum? No, that would be correct to say. Dr. Lufer has published some incredibly important research on this topic, showing that the more affluent teens are actually those that disproportionately suffer in terms of their mental health from the achievement pressures that they experience at school. They're the ones that are most aggressively primed for elite college. They experience a lot of psychological difficulties, substance abuse issues and behavioural issues. A lot of which is actually not as documented, I think, as perhaps it should be. We quite rightly focus on the more deprived end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Absolutely we do because there's a lot of suffering there for many, many reasons. Also at the same time, I think it's important for us to highlight that there are teens at the higher end of the socioeconomic spectrum who are suffering from an excessive need to achieve. So much pressure they're putting on themselves, partly rooted in perfectionism, but having impacts more broadly on their mental health. Is the educational system itself contributing to this? I know kids today come home with hours of homework. When I was a kid, maybe I had a half an hour or max an hour's worth of homework every night. I don't know how kids do it today. It's an incredibly tough schooling process. I think, on average, there's about 130 standardised tests that young people undertake from kindergarten to the 12th grade. That's an incredible amount of testing and ranking and sifting and sorting. You can only imagine the ways in which young people begin to construe a sense of self and identity in those contexts, which is essentially self identity that's pinned to how well we perform, where we sit in the rank. Of course, it's a very fragile sense of self-worth because the moment things go wrong, or the moment we get a bad test score, our self-esteem plummets and we start to experience a lot of rumination, shame, guilt, stress. There's no doubt that there's a lot of pressure in schooling. I understand the need for standardised testing. Of course, there is a place for it. I think what we have at the moment is an excessive culture of standardised testing, which is creating a lot of worry and a lot of anxiety. Given your knowledge of all this, do you go easy on your students? Do you give fewer tests? I don't want to give them any tests if I can avoid it. I feel like they've done that enough at this point. The way that I try to assess is really to emphasise the feedback, to make sure that I... Especially in the first year, because in the UK system, the first year doesn't count anything as much. We try not to even give them a grade. It's all about what was done well, what could be improved. Those are the things to focus on as you develop your understanding and knowledge in a certain area. That's difficult because it's really jarring for students to come into that different way of learning, to not have a grade and to not have something they can anchor their sense of self around. Ultimately, it's a much healthier way to learn, I think. Is there such a thing as healthy perfectionism? Can you be a perfectionist in a way that's not detrimental to your wellbeing? I'm going to say no, but this is a contentious topic. If you speak to other psychologists in the area, you may get different answers. It's all good fun, but it does hit on something really important. That's the question of whether this is a construct that we need to find the positives in, or it's something that we need to find a completely different track to. There is nothing positive about perfectionism. We need to step onto a different pathway. Even the high standards, the excessive standards are themselves negative, in my mind, for two reasons. The first is because even if we do meet those high and excessive standards, the perfectionists can never enjoy them because there's always going to be more to come.to be something more. So we can't appreciate our successes even if we get them. And also, of course, those problems and things don't go quite so well for those high standard perfectionists because that's a big hit to their self-esteem. And so what they tend to do is avoid and dither and iterate and procrastinate to try to avoid those feelings of shame and guilt from making a mistake or hitting a setback. So that actually blocks our progress in the end. It doesn't carry us forward. And so for my mind, I think that the negatives far outweigh any positives that you might find from being a perfectionist. And it's much better to try to situate ourselves on a better track where we're focusing on our efforts. We're focusing on the process of learning. We're trying to hit high goals, but we're maintaining a sense of perspective and that we're allowing ourselves to enjoy successes when they arrive. Those are all markers of a high achiever, and it doesn't preclude high achievement by taking a slightly different track. But what it does mean is that we can enjoy the process. And as a consequence, we can find psychological wellbeing, purpose and meaning through that process, which are things that we just simply can't do if perfectionism is in the driving seat. Part of your story is that you were a perfectionist. Isn't that true? I mean, you recognize that in yourself and it kind of changed the way that you approach life. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah. Like a lot of people these days who are trying to climb the career ladder, perfectionism really did take over in my own life, particularly in my early to mid-twenties when I was working all sorts of hours to try to lift myself above other people, to try and get as many publications out there as I could, to try and win as many grants as I could, to looking around at how other people are doing and using that as my benchmark for how good I should be doing. There's an argument to suggest that it was part of why I'm here, but also it came at heavy cost. I burnt out. I had to leave work for a number of months. It was a very difficult period in my personal life as well because it created all sorts of overflows in terms of the weight of my relationships with other people. So there was a lot of collateral. Although ostensibly I looked like I was a high achiever, underneath I was really sinking. That was an impetus for me to take a different direction, choose a different track, to try to remove those narcissistic self-referenced tendencies that I held within me, that contingent self-esteem that I held within me based on my achievement and how I was appearing relative to other people, and actually just try to be more centered and focus on what it is that I want to leave in the world. What it is I want to learn and I want to share. Flicking that switch really helped me because it gave me a bigger purpose. It made me look more holistically fueled. It made me want to ask bigger questions about what's happening at a societal level. Ultimately, that was the real reason why I think I'm here. If I continued on that track, I'd have burnt out and I would be really struggling. But now I'm able to have good work-life balance and ask really interesting questions, which is one of the reasons I'm talking to you, I suppose. Given that experience and also the research that you've done, do you have advice, really specific advice for people who recognize the harmful perfectionist tendencies that they have and they want to change? What can they do? There's loads of things to bear in mind. Again, that's also probably another book, but there's a few things that I found really useful in my experience and also to have some evidence behind them. The first is that self-compassion is a big part of combating perfectionism. Self-compassion is really about recognizing that we are a fallible, exhaustible human being and that we're going to make mistakes and we're going to hit setbacks. That's just part and parcel of what it means to be human. Recognizing that and actually internalizing that and then making sure that we check in on ourselves when things go wrong. We go in on ourselves and maybe we're partially self-critical about how can you be so stupid? Making sure we actively step in and intervene in those moments and find constructive and compassionate ways to move forward is really, really important because silencing that inner critic is a big part of combating perfectionism. I think also on a work basis, one of the things I found really useful is to try to prioritize and put my priorities into buckets. There are things that require high level diligence. There are things that require the activities to be good enough. Then there are things that just need to get done. Not everything has to be done at 100 miles an hour. Not everything has to be done to the minute detail. Maybe some things require a bit of conscientiousness, but actually most things in the work life don't. To be an efficient worker, we have to prioritize efficiently too. We have to recognize that there are some tasks where good enough is good enough and actually making progress is more important than getting things absolutely perfect first time round. It definitely helped me in terms of prioritizing and putting my tasks into buckets and allowing myself, giving myself permission for things not quite to be of a certain standard for tasks that don't need to be of that certain standard. Finally, I also like to journal. I think this is a lot of evidence for journaling for all sorts of psychological ailments, but particularly for perfectionism. Just writing down our fears can be so important. One of the things that blocks perfectionist people is the fear that things might go wrong. They catastrophize a lot. So writing down your fears, not ignoring them or suppressing them, but actually writing them down. What is it you're worried about? What's stopping you from making progress in this moment? Write it down. Journal it. Then ask yourself, what practical steps can I put in place to avoid that worst caseAnd then draw it through to its conclusion if it were to happen. So let's say it did happen. What can we do to bring ourselves back to square one, right? And just putting those fears under the microscope and putting practical ways forward in the case to avoid it in the first case, but then in the case of actually happening, how do we move ourselves back is a really, really good way to break down those fears. And it allows us to have a roadmap to move forward. And then we could just get on and do it without that fear holding us back. What about parents and other caregivers? What can they do to encourage their kids while buffering them from the pressures that lead to perfectionism? I mean, you know you want your kid to get into the best school, but how can you keep your child from becoming overly anxious and suffering? Yeah, there's a few things I would recommend to parents. First thing is don't put too much pressure on yourself because parenting is one of the hardest jobs in the world. And you can go into it with the best intentions and you can find very quickly that you're reduced to a helpless spectator. And that's just normal and natural and part of the process. So that I think is the first thing. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to get things just right. Winnicott's idea of the good enough parent is something that springs to mind when I think about parenting. You can't perfect everything. And that's good for kids because life is not perfect. So a couple of practical things. Well, first of all, don't hitch your approval to achievement or how much effort kids are putting in, particularly when it comes to sports or academic activities. It's good to have standards. It's good to want children to do the best they can, but you have to be really careful as parents not to subtly qualify your approval based on the expectation that young people do more. Because it's very easy to slip into that trap when young people have done well, they've come home, they've got an A in their test and you go, that's great. Okay, keep working. Because that full approval, full validation and recognition of parents is subtly withheld under the understanding of more. So essentially what we're doing is we're holding young people on tiptoes under the expectation to keep working. And that teaches them that they're only really worth something in this world if they strive and strive and strive. And if they achieve and achieve and achieve, and the moment they don't, then the implication is that other people value them less. So conditional forms of acceptance are really problematic when it comes to development of perfectionism. So it's really important that you give your kids full unqualified approval when they've done well, but also when things haven't gone quite so well. You give them a hug, you tell them it's okay. It's just one test of many of the tests. It's not an indictment on you. It doesn't say anything about whether your teacher likes you or whether you're good at this particular subject. It's just one test. And the most important thing is to immerse yourself in the learning process and things will turn around if you keep doing the revision and the reading and all the rest of it. I think it's really important to put our arm around our children in those moments and make sure that we give just as much acceptance when they've done well, when they haven't done quite so well. And the second thing I would say is also just normalize mistakes, failures, setbacks. If you've had a bad day at work, it's okay to communicate that with young people. It's okay to sit around the dinner table and laugh about it. It lets them know that these things happen. It's part and parcel of the real world. And that if their parents can laugh about it, if their parents can share it openly, then that gives them permission to do it too. And so those are the two main ones. But as I said at the beginning, it's really, really hard. And to any parent out there, you're doing a great job. Is there something we can be doing on a societal level to stop this rise in perfectionism? Yes. And one of the things that I write about the final part of the book is how society might need to change to provide less pressure or provide a context of less pressure, particularly on young people. And there are many things that I've recommended, none of which I think are necessarily going to be implemented, but they're almost quite utopic in some ways. But I do think that if they were, we would see less pressure. One of which is an expansion of participation in higher education. I think it's scandalous, actually, that universities haven't expanded participation, because all we're really doing is excluding more and more kids as colleges become more and more competitive. And that's not the way forward. I think there needs to be vast investment in education. Education has so many benefits at a societal level, not just for young people, but for society at large. And the more that we don't increase the pie at universities, the more that's going to become more competitive and the more pressure is going to be on young people to gain access. So I think that's one thing we could do to help. Another thing is, I think at a broader level, I'm a really big advocate of UBI. I think universal basic income is something that we're probably going to see anyway as AI comes in to capture a lot of productivity and jobs. I think it's going to be needed as an emergency measure to bridge the gap between that world now and the new world where AI does a lot of the work that we used to do. But I think that will have many, many benefits. And in particular, it will take away the scarcity that often is the fire for perfectionism. This idea that if we take a risk but it doesn't pay off, that we're going to be destitute is a lot of fear. It's a lot of worry. It's a lot of precarity. And that creates a lot of perfectionism at a societal level. And UBI has been advocated across the board from left to right on its ability to spur creativity, to spur innovation, to give almost a safety net that allows us to try new things and be innovative. And without it, it stifles that innovation.Perfectionism holds us back. There are other things I advocate in the book, but I think those are the two big ones. What's next for you? What are you working on? What's your next book? At the moment, I'm just going to take a little bit of time off to recover from what's been a grueling year or two. I've loved writing the book. I've loved getting out there. I've loved speaking to people. I've loved talking about perfectionism. It's really one of the reasons I did it was to spread the message, but at the same time, it's quite exhausting as well. I have a young family now, and I think it's time for me to switch gears a little bit and focus on my family, and then maybe in a few years' time, I'll write another book. I have some ideas on what might come next, but I think for now, I'm just going to listen to my own advice and get a bit of work-life balance.
