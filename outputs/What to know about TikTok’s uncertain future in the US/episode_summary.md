What to know about TikTok's uncertain future in the US and the people who want to buy it? I'm Imran Shaikh, and this is a Tuesday Daily Crunch special. TikTok, owned by the Chinese company Bikedance, has been at the center of controversy in the US for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the US that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored. TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store last week. Nonetheless, TikTok's future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform's US business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research's senior vice president, Angelo Zeno. So what's happened so far? Well, to fully understand this high-stakes drama, we'll first revisit the timeline of TikTok's tumultuous relationship with the US government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations. The drama first began in August 2020, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company Bikedance. A month later, Trump's administration sought to force a sale of TikTok's US operations to a US-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a US judge temporarily blocked Trump's executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded. Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The US House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill. Shortly thereafter, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response, TikTok sued the US government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the US complies with all local laws. And then, Trump had a change of heart. On December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the US. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok. In January, the US Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, commonly referred to as the TikTok ban. TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19. So TikTok shut down and then came back online. Although TikTok indeed shut itself down in the US when the act came into effect, it didn't last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted as a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the US. Where are we today? Well, on January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a US company. No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon. And now a list of investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok's US operations. Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them. The People's Bid for TikTok is a consortium organized by Project Liberty founder Frank McCourt, who's also the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, investment firm Guggenheim Securities, and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis are helping to assemble the bid. The main mission of the People's Bid to acquire TikTok is to prioritize privacy and data control, taking an open source approach. Supporters involved include Kevin O'Leary, a well-known investor and television personality who previously told Fox he was willing to buy TikTok for $20 billion. O'Leary joined the People's Bid on January 6. The inventor of the World Wide Web. No, we're not talking about Al Gore, we're talking about Tim Berners-Lee. He supports the proposal because users should have an ability to control their own data, Berners-Lee said in a statement. David Clark, a senior research scientist at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Clark has also been named a participant.Next is the American Investor Consortium. Jesse Tinsley, the CEO and founder of Employer.com, is leading a consortium of American investors. Last week, Tinsley announced a $30 billion all-cash offer to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. David Bozuki, Tinsley told Bloomberg that the Roblox co-founder and CEO is a participant. Nathan McCauley, the co-founder and CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, has been confirmed to be participating in the consortium, Bloomberg reported. And Mr. YouTube himself, Mr. Beast, Jimmy Donaldson, the popular YouTube creator is also a reported member of the investor group. Other interested parties? Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision. Oracle, the company previously made a bid for TikTok back in 2020. In front of the White House last month, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison said to Trump that 50% ownership seems like a good deal. Walmart, the retail giant, could also be eyeing TikTok to enhance its reach in e-commerce, especially considering the platform's influence on consumer shopping behavior. Walmart first expressed interest way back in the way back of 2020. Microsoft, the tech giant, has previously shown interest in acquiring TikTok, and Trump mentioned that the company has recently re-entered the bidding to buy the app. Cue that very specific Star Trek fight music. Rumble, the YouTube alternative, announced on X that it wants to acquire TikTok and serve as its cloud technology partner. And it can't be a thing about tech unless AI was involved. Perplexity AI, the AI search engine startup, submitted a bid last month, according to CNBC. And that's your Daily Crunch.
