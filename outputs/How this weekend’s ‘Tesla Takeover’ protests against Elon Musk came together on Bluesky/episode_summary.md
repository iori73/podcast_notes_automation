## **要約**

TechCrunchの最新ニュースによると、Metaはコメントの「Dislike」ボタンを非表示にし、将来的にはDislikeがコメントのランキングに影響するようになると発表しました。一方、Elon Muskに対する抗議活動が拡大しています。ムスクの政府に対する活動に対抗するムーブメントは、世界最高の富豪に打撃を与えることを目指しています。2月15日には、テスラのディーラーショップ前で抗議が計画されており、数百人の人々がこれに賛同しています。これはジョーン・ドノバンによって急速に広まり、アレックス・ウィンターによって加速されました。抗議活動はアメリカだけでなく、国際的にも計画されているとのことです。また、XAIは新たな資金調達を検討しており、XAIの価値を750億ドルに評価する予定です。それに伴い、XAIはDellから50億ドル以上のサーバーを購入し、AI技術の開発をサポートする計画です。これによって、Elon Muskのソーシャルネットワークに搭載される機能が増えると報じられています。TechCrunch.comで最新情報をチェックしてください。

This is TechCrunch. From the creators of the popular science show with millions of YouTube subscribers comes the MinuteEarth podcast. Every episode of the show dives deep into a science question you might not even know you had, but once you hear the answer you'll want to share it with everyone you know. Why do rivers curve? Why did the T-Rex have such tiny arms? And why do so many more kids need glasses now than they used to? Spoiler alert, it isn't screen time. Our team of scientists digs into the research and breaks it down into a short entertaining explanation, jam-packed with science facts and terrible puns. Subscribe to MinuteEarth wherever you like to listen. As a longtime foreign correspondent, I've worked in lots of places, but nowhere as important to the world as China. I'm Jane Perlez, former Beijing bureau chief for The New York Times. On Face Off, the US versus China, we'll explore what's critical to this important global relationship. Trump and Xi Jinping, AI, TikTok, and even Hollywood. New episodes of Face Off are available now wherever you get your podcasts. We're gonna get to how this weekend's Tesla takeover protests against Elon Musk came together on Blue Sky. I'm Imran Shaikh and it's time for your Saturday Daily Crunch, starting with three big headlines. Alright, so back in November we broke the news that Meta, owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, with billions of users accounting for 10% of all fixed and 22% of all mobile traffic, was close to announcing work on a major new $10 billion plus subsea cable project to connect up the globe. The aim was to give Meta more control over how it runs its own services. Well, today Meta confirmed details of our report. Project Waterworth is the official name and it will be 50,000 kilometers long when completed, making it the world's longest subsea cable project. Lining up with what we heard about the project months ago, the network will connect five continents with landing points in the United States, Brazil, India, South Africa, and other key regions. Facebook particularly calls out the opportunities in India and the role that the network will play in how it rolls out AI services globally as two key reasons for building the network. In terms of the network itself, Meta says it'll be breaking new ground with its architecture using 24 fiber pair cables and what it describes as first-of-its-kind routing, maximizing the cable laid in deep water at depths up to 7,000 meters along with new burial techniques to reduce faults in areas deemed high-risk, either because of geographical issues or politics, and sometimes both. After users noticed a new button on Instagram to downvote or dislike comments, the company confirmed that it's testing a way for users to signal that they either didn't like the comment or don't think it's relevant. The feature will appear across both feed posts and reels. Instagram head Adam Asari said in a post on threads that the company won't show a dislike count and no one will know you've disliked a comment. He added that eventually dislikes will count toward ranking comments. Meta said that this test is to contribute toward improving the quality of the comment section. As Elon Musk and his acolytes rip through the federal government looking for agencies to throw into the wood chipper, a grassroots effort to hit the world's richest man where it hurts is picking up steam. The courts are busy contesting the actions of Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, but the judicial system is slow and citizens are getting antsy. Some in the US who are aghast at Musk's government bloodletting have sold their Teslas or gone straight to vandalism. But hundreds of others now plan to protest that Tesla dealerships across the country on February 15th, a movement that quickly spun up this past week by disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and accelerated by documentary filmmaker and Bill & Ted franchise star Alex Winter on Blue Sky. What started on Blue Sky has spread to planned protests outside Tesla showrooms across the country in cities like Austin, Portland, Seattle, Kansas City and Mesa, Arizona. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. TechCrunch will update if Musk or the automaker responds. Winter told TechCrunch in an interview that he partnered with the Disruption Project, a group that offers training for people interested in mass activism. He said hundreds of people have RSVP'd to the various events so far and that more are popping up each day. Winter also said he's even heard from people who are planning them internationally. Now the protests are about more than shaping optics and building community, Winter said. Musk's vast wealth is in large part tied to his ownership of about 20% of Tesla stock. That makes him somewhat vulnerable to large swings in the company's stock price, doubly so because he has borrowed an incredible amount of money against those shares. And we'll wrap up with your startup news for the weekend. Speaking of Musk, XAI is said to be in talks to raise $10 billion in a round that would value XAI at $75 billion. Bloomberg reported Friday that XAI is canvassing existing investors including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Valor Equity Partners for the round, which would bring XAI's total raise to $22.4 billion according to CrunchBase. Bloomberg also noted that discussions are ongoing and that the terms of the fundraising round may change. The potential new injection of capital comes as XAI reportedly weighs buying more than $5 billion worth of servers from Dell to support the development of its AI technologies, including its Grok models. Grok powers a growing number of features on Elon Musk's ex-social network.Including summaries of trending discussions. And that's your Daily Crunch. Today's stories were reported by Ingrid Linton, Sean O'Kane, and more beautiful, lovely TechCrunch journalists. We'll see you here next week and until then, find us at TechCrunch.com. It's hosted by Andrew Gene Kola, and it's packed with tips on how to build wealth, creating multiple income streams, and just making your money work for you. I recently listened to an episode called The 6 Numbers You Must Know To Build Wealth. In it, Andrew breaks down, you guessed it, 6 actionable steps anyone can take to start building their financial future in a way that makes it feel simple and not overwhelming.

According to the latest from TechCrunch, Meta announced that the 'dislike' button on comments will be hidden and, in the future, dislikes will factor into how comments are ranked. Meanwhile, the movement to protest Elon Musk has scaled up.

The movement was amplified by Joan Donovan and accelerated by Alex Winter. Protests are not just planned in the US, they will happen internationally. And XAI is exploring a new funding round that would value the company at $75 billion. In related news, XAI is planning to buy more than $5 billion worth of servers from Dell to aid in the development of their AI technology.
