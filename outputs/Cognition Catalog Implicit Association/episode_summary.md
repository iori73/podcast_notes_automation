The speaker in this episode delves into the concept of implicit association bias and its impact on teamwork within a software development context. Implicit association bias refers to unconscious mental connections between ideas, which can influence decision-making and team dynamics. This bias can lead to favoritism, inhibit skill development among team members, and hinder collaboration by perpetuating negative stereotypes. By distinguishing between implicit associations and stereotypes, teams can address biases effectively and foster a more equitable work environment. The speaker offers practical strategies to mitigate implicit bias, such as recognizing hidden biases, questioning initial reactions, empathizing with others' perspectives, ensuring objectivity in promotions, and looking beyond first impressions in the hiring process. Understanding and actively working against implicit biases can lead to fairer decisions and improved teamwork. This episode provides valuable insights on navigating implicit association bias in the workplace and beyond.

So how biased do you think you are? You're likely thinking to yourself, biased? Not me. But here's the thing with biases, they often fly under our own radar and they're generally very hard to avoid as most of these things tend to happen in our subconscious before we even realize that we're doing it. That's why implicit association can be so nefarious and dangerous. So stick around and we'll learn all about it. What's up, UX fam? Welcome to another edition of the Cognition Catalog. Every week we'll dig into a new cognitive bias and explore how that bias can impact how our team works together and what we can do to ensure that we don't get caught up in the pitfalls. Because working with people is hard and the more insights we have into the human condition makes it just a little bit easier. To learn more about implicit association, you can find more resources at CognitionCatalog.com, sign up for the newsletter, get a new bias in your inbox every week, and make sure to subscribe wherever you listen to podcasts so you never have to worry about falling for implicit association again.

You're probably thinking, I'm not biased, no way. But here's the thing with most of the biases that we talk about here on this show, many of them happen without us even realizing it. And that's why implicit association can be so dangerous. We often make split-second decisions on things all the time, and this can be completely innocuous, like a preference for savory over sweet things, or it can be more insidious, like instinctively assuming that someone is ignorant because of their accent. Now, unfortunately, we make these quick decisions based on how someone looks, talks, dresses, what school they went to, where they live. Now, these types of things spill over in work all the time, and they often go unnoticed by the people doing it. It's not called explicit association after all. Over the years, I've seen lots of hiring decisions go one way or another, simply because someone on the hiring team made a quick judgment, either good or bad, about the candidate based on something superficial, like clothes, accent, work history, background, whatever. I've also seen the same happen with promotions, raises, recognition, assignments, and a lot more. It isn't necessarily that the person who made the decision was a bad person. The issue is that most of these decisions happen without us even realizing it. So let's talk about it. What is implicit association? Now, we often make unconscious associations between different things, and these automatic associations can shape our behavior and our decisions, even when we consciously believe that we are acting fairly and impartially. Now, this bias can illustrate the powerful influence of our subconscious mind on our everyday interactions and our judgments. The study of implicit association bias started to take off in the late 1900s. Now, before that, scientists had looked at attitudes and stereotypes, but they hadn't really dug into the unconscious part of our thinking. In 1998, a group of researchers came up with a new way to measure these hidden biases. They created something called the implicit association test. You might see this called IAT. Now, this test asks people to quickly sort words or pictures into different categories. And then by looking at how fast people respond, the test can show connections in our minds that we might not even know that we have. The implicit association test became a big deal in studying biases about things like race, gender, and age. And it showed that even people who say they don't have biases might still have them without even consciously realizing it. And as more scientists started using the implicit association test, they found that these hidden biases could affect lots of areas in life. For example, they discovered that just seeing more women in leadership positions could help reduce gender stereotypes, at least for a little while. The idea of implicit association has actually made a pretty big impact. Schools started thinking about how teacher expectations might affect student performance. Hospitals took a look at whether hidden biases might lead to some patients getting better care than others. Companies started changing how they hire people to try to be more fair. Now, in software teams, implicit association can cause problems without anybody even noticing it. For example, we might automatically trust feedback from younger users more than older users. This could happen because we might unconsciously think that younger people, they just know more about technology. And as a result, the app might end up being hard for older people to use. A team leader might always pick ideas from the same few people during brainstorming sessions. For instance, they might do this because the people remind them of successful innovators that they've seen before. Maybe this could mean that great ideas from other team members get completely ignored. Some engineers might get the most interesting stories or tickets because they look or act like the stereotypical image of a quote-unquote good developer. This could stop other team members from getting chances to grow their skills and show what they can do. Implicit association can also affect how different team members work together. So designers might automatically think engineers aren't creative. Well, engineers might think designers don't understand technical stuff. This can ultimately make it hard for teams to work together well and come up with the best possible solutions. Now, it's worth noting that implicit association is not exactly the same as implicit stereotypes. Implicit associations are those quick mental connections between any two ideas. While implicit stereotypes are a specific type of association that usually links groups of people with certain traits. And while all implicit stereotypes are implicit associations, not all implicit associations are stereotypes. And in the workplace, both can affect team dynamics.But being aware of this distinction can help teams address these biases more effectively and create a fair work environment. So what can you do about it? Well, here are a few key takeaways. First, I think it's really important to just accept that everybody has hidden biases. Even if you think that you're always fair, you probably fall for them too. It's not about being a bad person. Knowing about your biases can often help you make better choices. Next, think twice about your first reaction. When you're deciding who to trust or whose idea is best, just stop and ask yourself if you might be favoring somebody unfairly. Try to look at things from a different angle if you can, before you actually make up your mind. Next, try seeing things from someone else's point of view. Try to do activities where team members have to imagine being somebody else or putting themselves in someone else's shoes. This might help you notice your own bias and understand the different ways of thinking and ultimately could lead to fair decisions and better teamwork. Next, if you're a manager, be objective with promotions and bonuses. Make a clear list of what's needed to earn these things. Ask others for input about each team member because the best person for a promotion might not always be the ones that you notice first. And lastly, look beyond first impressions. When you're hiring, make a list of the skills and qualities that you really need for the job. Then use that list to guide your choice. And if you can try to meet with candidates more than once and have a different team member talk to them each time. So it's not always the same person providing feedback. Well, all right, y'all, that's it for the cognition catalog for today. I hope we helped to shed a little bit of light on what implicit association is and how we can avoid some of these pitfalls at work and at home.
