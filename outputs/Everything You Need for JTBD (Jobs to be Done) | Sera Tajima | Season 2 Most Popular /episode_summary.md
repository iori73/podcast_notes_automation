Hey everyone, we're on a short break between seasons, but I wanted to share some of our most popular episodes with you from season 2 that you may have missed. Before we jump into the episode, a big thank you to everyone who follows the podcast and engages with it. This helps us attract the right audience and guest speakers. Please follow the podcast if you haven't already and I have a quick ask for you. I want to know what topics you'd like to hear more about and if you have a particular expert that you would really like to hear from. Comment below and let me know. In terms of upcoming events, I'll be giving a talk on technology for a sustainable future at the University of Hawaii at Manoa on January 15th. Enjoy the episode. People don't want to buy a quarter inch drill. They want a quarter inch hole. Welcome to the Sarah Tajima podcast, where we discuss conscious design for humanity and the planet. Hey, it's Sarah. Welcome back to the podcast. Today, we are talking about jobs to be done. So I've scoured expert knowledge and books to bring you this very comprehensive guide with my own twist on jobs to be done. So I've really consolidated a lot of the information here. Competitive innovation is killing companies quicker. Technological innovation is increasing, but companies are dying quicker. In 1960, companies spent an average of 55 years on the S&P 500. And in 2015, it dropped to only 20 years. So what's happening? Well, it comes down to creative destruction. Companies are not innovating and then they die. People don't want to buy a quarter inch drill, they want a quarter inch hole. And this quote by Theodore Levitt so beautifully describes the challenge that we're dealing with here as a company, as a founder, or as a designer, you need to know about JTBD or jobs to be done. So I posted on LinkedIn before about why you should consider not listening to your customer. And while you're wondering, no, I haven't lost it. Thank you for your concern. You should be talking to your customer, but not necessarily taking them literally and you'll find out why. So first, we'll talk about creative destruction. And then we'll talk about JTB three components and practical application. Next week in my newsletter, I'm sharing a step by step guide to JTBD. So make sure that you get that by subscribing. The question is why focus on customer jobs. I personally like JTBD because I believe that it holds space for how to innovate, not one taking orders from customers like a chef, no shade to chefs, or two equally bad force your solution onto customers. Through my experience, I've found that too many startups actually neglect competitive research, talking to trend customers, understanding why potential customers are not interested in your product or service, and asking customers about what other options they explored to solve the problem. You never know your competition may actually be Google sheets, somewhere between 75 to 85% of all new products launched into the market don't succeed financially. And this quote is from Clayton Christensen, who is one of the creators of JTBD theory. So therefore, we actually need to ask ourselves, why would anyone purchase my product over any other market option? When we create products, we often focus on things like features, functionality and the UI. But let's shift our perspective for a moment and ask, what job is this product meant to do? And why does the user use this product? It all boils down to the assumption that all people are trying to progress in life. Nobody cares about the nuts and bolts, they care about how it will improve their life. And I'm going to share some images here just to illustrate the point. So the first one being all the nuts and bolts and this skateboarder, what they actually just want is to enjoy skateboarding to improve their life and to enjoy their life. So they don't care about how it all comes together or how it works. We need to innovate to survive creative destruction. The process of creative destruction happens when new innovations disrupt the sales of incumbent ones, and eventually replace them. JTBD helps us understand creative destruction. Customers can only use one product at a time. For example, in this great book, when coffee and kale compete, Alan Clement uses the example of Kodak's disruption. In 1975, one of the engineers actually made a digital camera, but management shelved it, claiming that they made billions from photographic film and selling digital would cannibalize their sales. What was the result? Well, as we know, in 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy. So what's the lesson here? If you don't disrupt yourself as a company, someone else will. Always keep an eye towards the future vision. Don't just help customers progress on today's need. Create solutions that help them make progress tomorrow. This means you need to hold that vision. Your customers probably can't tell you what that is, but with your bird's eye view, you can ascertain it using things like JTBD. You also shouldn't rely on your customers for direction, because if you haven't realized it yet, customers will often inadvertently lie. I've encountered my own share of customers saying one thing when the data tells a different story. In fact, just last week, I reached out to people taking the sustainable growth playbook in order to understand how I could improve it. And one of the people I reached out to had not finished the entire course. And she responded immediately agreeing to meet and told me how much she liked it and how useful it was and how she recommended it to all her friends. But what she neglected to say is that she hadn't actually finished it. So we need to read between the lines in order to create a great product and not just take our customers word for it. With that said, let's talk about JTBD theory and practice. This is where JTBD comes into the picture.We're going to understand why and how customers use jobs for self-betterment. JTBD theory states that every product exists to fulfill a specific job or purpose in people's lives. And JTBD theory, as I mentioned earlier, was popularized by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen and Bob Moesta, now who I believe was mentored by Clayton. However, there are many people associated with JTBD theory and practice today, including Tony Ulwich, who you may find if you do a Google of JTBD, Pam Murtaugh, Julia Wesson, Rick Petty, John Palmer, Alan Clement, Jim Kalbach, and more. For JTBD practitioners, at the end of the day, product building is not about the bells and whistles. It's about addressing a problem. This actually sounds like design, right? So, our task is to understand every facet of these jobs. Jobs describe the underlying human needs, not the feature of the product. So, through the lens of jobs to be done, we can examine how products help customers get a job done more effectively, efficiently, and joyfully. We need to empathize with the challenges that these individuals face, the goals they aspire to achieve, and the outcomes that they desire. And JTBD is not to be mistaken with personas. These are two different things. I've gotten that question before. So, if you want to head over to the newsletter, and I'll link it, you can read more about that. In my opinion, the value of JTBD is that it solves real customer problems. It helps you find product market fit as a startup. You can better acquire and retain customers, survive disruption from competitors. And probably something that I should add here is that it helps you market better. It helps you communicate better to the customer in order to acquire them. However, marketing is not something that I'm going to focus on in this episode. In this episode, we'll focus on this more from a product perspective and design perspective. There are three dimensions to understand jobs. The JTBD theory is composed of these three dimensions that help us understand the jobs the customer needs to accomplish, and the context in which they are seeking solutions. So the theory holistically examines three key dimensions, functional, emotional and social. So the functional dimension focuses on the practical needs and the desired outcome the customer is looking to fulfill. It involves understanding the specific tasks, problems, or goals customers are trying to accomplish. The second is the emotional dimension. And this explores the feelings, desires and aspirations associated with a job to be done. It recognizes that customers are not only motivated by functional objectives, but also by emotional gratification. And this is a huge one. If you want to learn more about this, I would highly suggest Don Norman's book on emotional design. I can also link that below. I'll link it in our resources. The third is the social dimension. And this considers the influence of social interactions, relationships and identity in fulfilling a job to be done. So people typically seek products or services that align with their social context, aspirations and desired image. And I would love it if you would comment and let me know if your organization is hitting all three. Because personally, I see a lot of organizations focusing almost exclusively on the functional. Spotify now has a new comment feature. So if you're listening to this on Spotify or YouTube, you can comment below, by the way. Let's take a look at an example of these three dimensions in order to better contextualize this. What's important to acknowledge about JTBD is that jobs can go from really large to micro on a scale. And you'll probably understand this if you think about, you know, the tasks that a person is doing versus like the different features that you have in a product. But let's use the example of improving a conference for attendees to understand how a dimension might break down into jobs. So for the functional dimension, it could be something like, help me meet new professionals in my industry and learn about the latest trends in AI. And examples of functional jobs could be attend three presentations or panel discussions specifically focused on recent AI developments. It could be participate in a hands-on workshop demonstrating a new AI tool or technique and identify and note three potential AI apps relevant to my current work projects. If we take a look at the emotional dimension, it could be something along the lines of make me feel inspired and energized about my professional growth. So examples of these emotional aspects could be feeling a sense of belonging amongst industry peers, experience excitement about new emerging technologies, and gain confidence in applying conscious design to design work. So for the social dimension, it could look something like enable me to be seen as a knowledgeable expert in my industry. And examples of social aspects could be being recognized as an active participant in workshops, it could be having the opportunity to ask insightful questions to the speakers, and it could be sharing insights and setting up a demo workshop for co-workers once you get back to work. Okay, so we're going to talk now about the nine tenants of JTBD, which comes from Tony Ulwich, who is the founder of Stratagen. And the way that Tony uses JTBD is a bit different from Bob Moesta, who is another popular proponent of JTBD, you can find a great talk by Bob on Lenny's newsletter and Lenny's podcast. Tony likes these because they help a company create steady growth. So the first is that people buy products and services to get a job done. The second is that jobs are functional with emotional and social components. So so far, these are should be pretty obvious, right? It's like what we've discussed three is that a job to be done is stable over time for a job to be done is solution agnostic. So notJumping to the solution, right? Five is success comes from making the job the unit of analysis rather than the product or the customer. And we'll talk about that a bit more in the step-by-step guide. Six is that a deep understanding of the customer's job makes marketing more effective and innovation far more predictable. Seven is that people want products and services that will help them get a job done better and or more cheaply, although I don't necessarily agree with the later part. Eight, people seek out products and services that enable them to get the entire job done on a single platform. And nine, innovation becomes predictable when needs are defined as the metrics customers use to measure success when getting the job done. So essentially being on the same page with your customer in terms of how to define success. Let's talk a little bit about how we could incorporate JTBD in your design process. The beauty of design thinking is that we start with clarity on the problems and not enforcing what we think the solution is. And that's why I think that so many startups can actually really benefit from having a designer, even though most startups tend to start with a bunch of engineers and zero designers. It can be shockingly simple when you follow these methods, though startups can often get chaotic because often they're moving too fast without clear intentions, or perhaps the founder doesn't really have a background in product development. So a product designer helps businesses succeed in creating the right product for customers. That's a huge one, right? It's not just creating whatever we think the solution is. And creating the right product really hinges on knowing the jobs that a customer is trying to accomplish, how the customer feels, what needs are unmet, and how to speak to the customer in a way that clicks. And even if you're not familiar with JTBD, there's a pretty good chance that you're using a lot of these techniques already because it's pretty ingrained in design thinking to go through some of the steps that we'll talk about later. So Bob Moesta shares this fascinating discovery that his mattress clients' biggest competition, once conducting the research, they discovered was actually ZQuill, the sleep aid, and not other mattress companies. I bet they didn't see that coming. So this just highlights how important research is. Incorporating JTBD is going to start with, one, clarity on audience and scope, and two, UX research. If you can understand every dimension, then you can solve for every dimension. And that, friends, is the way to stand out in a crowded market. Now we're going to go into the step-by-step guide that I have prepared. And again, this is kind of taking everything that I could possibly find on JTBD and incorporating it into something that I would recommend for product designers, or there's other people involved in this process. So it could also be product managers or engineers on your team, or even just stakeholders that you need to update about your progress. So the point of incorporating JTBD is really to investigate beyond the superficial layer. The focus on gathering more and more data about customers is actually wrong. There's a ton of statistics on companies gathering a ton of data on customers, which is also a privacy risk, and then they never even end up using the data. What companies really need is to understand the customer's underlying motivations. What does the customer hope to accomplish? And trust me, you may think you know, but you likely have no idea. I mean, let's go back to Bob's example of ZQuill as the biggest competitor to this mattress company. So incorporating JTBD in your development process will ultimately help you find that magic missing piece that makes the irrational rational. And this is similar to Don Norman's message in this book, Emotional Design, where he talks about how if you dig deep enough, then there's actually a reason for why people behave the way that they do that is rational, even though from the superficial layer, it looks irrational. So we also talk about that on Don's podcast episode, if you want to go listen to that after this one. And as Bob Moesta says, connect the supply with the demand side. It starts with demand and struggling moments exist before there is even a product. So before we get into this guide, we need to get into the right mindset. So forget who you are, forget your company and go in with an open mind. The goal is to understand the job executor and your company and your proposed solution is not even relevant at this point. With that said, let's get started. And because this is essentially a list, a task list, you can go to the newsletter if you would prefer to read it. So the first thing is to define your market, your job executor and your jobs. It could be plural. Defining a market around the job to be done provides a stable long-term focal point around which companies can create value. And it's helpful to clearly define the audience because your end user may not actually be your customer. There can be differences between having multiple end users, for example, or the person purchasing or the person with the decision-making power. So you want to go through and clearly define this with your team. You also want to communicate the JTBD framework to stakeholders, especially if you're planning on doing workshops around this or even just for the sake of planning. You'll determine who is trying to get the job done, understand if there are any other players involved that you need to be aware of and determine what exactly the jobs are. And at a high level, you should have some sort of example, although you might further flesh this out in the next step when we do research. As for company examples, Zoom exists to help connect remote workers, Wyze exists to help individuals transfer money quickly globally, and Lyft or Uber exists to help passengers get from point A to point B. Okay, so let's go into step two, UX research. And this is going to be a really big and important bulk of this. The goal of UX research is to understand the jobs a customer must accomplish, motivations, unmet needs, pain points, success rates, and so on. So let's dive into step one, UX research. And this is going to be a really big and important bulk of this. The goal of UX research is to understandTimeline and so forth. And hopefully this is not new to you because this is what good product designers are doing anyways in their research process or good UX researchers. Earlier I actually mentioned that customers don't always give you accurate data in customer interviews which is why even though you should absolutely be talking to customers and taking note of everything that they say, you should also be sort of corroborating this with other data when possible. This is why it's a good idea to 1. Ask the same question several times in different ways. You'd be surprised at how you actually get different answers to the same exact question when you reword it. And the second thing that I would recommend is to combine qualitative data with quantitative data. So in the example I gave earlier when I reached out to someone they said they loved the course it was great blah blah blah but they neglected to mention that they hadn't finished it and that I was able to see through quantitative data. Okay so tips for this step. Get a diverse group of participants that fit the criteria of your job executor. Craft your customer interview questions using the three dimensions so you'll want to dig into understanding all of these. Create a guide of questions while leaving padding to explore answers deeper. I want to take pause to talk about this one a little bit more because if you listen to interviews with some of the JTB experts like Bob Moesta he recommends not having even a guide of questions which I think could give UX researchers a heart attack but my recommendation here is to always have a guide of kind of core questions where you really think through very carefully the different categories and things that you want to talk about but within that leave room leave some padding let's say so maybe you know account for the questions that you have are going to take 30 minutes but book this session for one hour which leaves you then padding to explore certain answers that the customer gives deeper and you know get more into the weeds with it and this is really like half art half science but the way that you handle this will really depend on the feedback that the customer gives you and so that's why you wouldn't necessarily have the same questions for every single customer but it's okay like that is done in UX research to have these questions but also to you know ask follow-up questions where it's relevant and where you want to dig deeper hopefully that was clear so then we want to focus on the progress that the user is trying to make what progress are they trying to make with the job that they're trying to complete we want to understand the goals timeline context obstacles and constraints for example what does the customer want to achieve and under what circumstances are there any overlooked or unmet needs that customers have in relation to the desired outcome what are the functional aspects of what they need done how do they want to feel and be perceived by others i found a lot of the stuff that bob shares in interviews very helpful and i watched a bunch of them so bob shares this technique called switch interviews and this involves talking to users who recently switched to or from your product to get to know you know what's going on why uh the drivers get to know the full timeline of their decision making process and more and this is something that i actually think is so underrated is talking to churn customers or even customers that you wouldn't necessarily go after because it seems from a surface level that they are not interested or are not a good candidate and let me give an example because this sounds very high level but for a startup client that i was working with a climate tech startup i conducted research with their ideal clientele which was kind of luxury retailers to use this sustainable wood product and what i recommended was actually talking to customers and understanding which customers were interested in sustainability and which customers were not and digging into why because there might be something there even when it comes to marketing even though i said i wouldn't speak about marketing that enables you to understand their motivations for why they're not interested in sustainability because it could be something that you could flip so when it comes to sustainability customers might think for example well i'm not interested in that because we don't have the budget for it because it's too expensive and clients are very concerned when it comes to architecture about the budget but if your product is considered luxury but it's not in the luxury price range then that could actually be something that you could modify just by having the right language when talking to your customer and doing the right marketing and similarly it can be very helpful to talk to customers and understand why they decided to stop using your product this is the type of research that i've also done with the client where it really was enlightening to understand what what the shortcomings essentially of our product was and why they decided to go to a competitor which one they chose and why because something that you'll find with jtbd that's highlighted is just because the customer is not making progress any longer with your product or company doesn't mean that they've stopped making progress they've just found a different way to go about it they've found a better alternative perhaps or a workaround when you're in the process of understanding the timeline of the decision making process you might also find it relevant to understand better who are the actors involved and who are the decision makers versus just the end user of the product and that could be particularly relevant for b2b the next step is to synthesize your research research is not as valuable without strong synthesis so this should not be neglected you'll want to gather all of your data and start analyzing and finding patterns you can particularly pay attention to understanding the three dimensions of jtbd but my favorite thing actually is to just use stickies of insights and kind of group them together organically to discover what you found so for the functional it could look something like what practical goals need to be achievedFor emotional, it could look like how does the user want to feel. And for social, something along the lines of how does the user want to be perceived. The fourth step here is going to be to map the job, and this is not to be confused with like a customer journey map. The JTBD job mapping happens in chronological order, and the purpose of job mapping is to discover what the customer is trying to get done at different points in execution, and what must happen pre, during, and post execution in order for that job to be considered successful. If you'd like to learn more about JTBD mapping, you can learn more about Anthony Olwick's method, and I have linked that in the newsletter. Tips here, you'll want to document the steps that users currently take to get the job done, and identify pain points and inefficiencies in the current process. Okay, five, you're going to identify customer needs, and this means define, categorize, capture, and organize all the customer's needs. Customer needs are best defined as the measurable outcomes, so if you can quantify that in some way, that's recommended. And you can map this in Figma, where you can get Stratagent's framework. I want to give this example of open AI for you, so we can look at ChatGPT, or we can look at Anthropic. Anthropic is what I'm using the most frequently. Their tool is called Claude, I believe right now it's 3.5. The core audience would be tech enthusiasts, professionals, marketers, educators, and students. Their motivations for using ChatGPT or Claude could be research, ideation, task automation, and personal assistance. The barriers might be time, accessibility for disabled users, workplace restrictions, or simply being lazy. And what are they hiring or firing is unique to JTBD. It could be personal assistance, brainstorming partners, Google search, and more. So the sixth step here is to create your JTBD statements, and these are similar to user stories, with the additional factor of when and what they want to avoid. Tips here, formulate clear action-oriented statements describing the job, and I'm going to give you the format. So the first one is, I want to, and then whatever the desire is, when, and then the context, so that I can, and then whatever that goal is, without, and then whatever the pain point is. Or here's a second way of framing this, which is essentially just the same thing, but this is a format that is used by meta. So when I, and whatever the context is, but, and then whatever the barrier is, help me, and then whatever the goal is, so I, and then whatever the desired outcome is. So I find that one like a little bit less clear, but it's up to you, you can use whichever one you want. And then let's go into seven. Seventh thing is to ideate solutions to address all dimensions. The problem should go beyond just addressing the functional dimensions, and that's the benefit of JTBD. This could look like brainstorming stickies, or even getting together with the immediate team for a workshop in the newsletter. Sorry, this is very link heavy, because I'm trying to link you to helpful resources, but I've linked a sample of an ideation workshop from the Crafts YouTube channel that I enjoy facilitating. It's an older one, but essentially the format is the same. Here you're going to brainstorm ways to help the user make progress on their jobs. Focus on removing obstacles and enhancing desired outcomes. Let's talk about eight, prioritization and planning. So the goal of innovation is to help customers get a job done better. And Tony Ulwich would add, and more cheaply, which I mentioned earlier, but I don't necessarily think that that's true. I will leave that up to your organization to decide what the goals are there and what the customer's motivations are, but let's focus on prioritization. So here you can use a prioritization matrix, and I like this matrix that I found from first round. So I will put that up here so that you can see it visually if you're watching this and you're able to take a look at the video. Otherwise, you can also find it in the newsletter. And here, basically, you're going to determine which jobs are important or frequent. You're going to identify jobs with high potential for innovation, and you're going to ensure that your product roadmap starts by addressing the high priority jobs. And you can put the rest on a backlog. I mean, you shouldn't waste the research that you've done. So make sure that you save that and revisit it later and actually revisit your backlog and make time for that, not just put it on the backlog and let it disappear. So the ninth step is going to be to design and test. You're going to design to solve the job based on your product roadmap. And this could even involve eliminating unnecessary things in an existing product. So this is actually something that I've done before. One company hired me essentially to remake the experience for one side of the marketplace. And through the research, I was able to uncover that a lot of the features were unnecessary and even confusing and created friction. So here, you're going to want to test with users once you do that to see if this actually helps get the job done, the changes that you've made, or the new experience that you've created. And you're going to gather feedback for improvement and find patterns with multiple users. So if one person has difficulty with something, then that might not be a sign that you should do anything about it. But if you discover six out of 10 people that you've done usability testing with have the same issue, that's probably a really good signal that something should be done. And then the 10th thing is to refine and measure impact. So you're going to use that feedback you've gathered to improve your solutions. This could also involve maybe having a look at the data.Doing some surveys, blending in more research methods. Here you want to continuously validate that you're addressing the right jobs. So that could even be doing another batch of customer interviews. Also want to here define metrics tied to job completion and not just to product usage. So at some point you should be taking a look at what you're going to define as success based on whatever jobs you're focused on. And the last thing that I want to highlight here is that you should absolutely be sharing your wins with your team and share the knowledge. So before we close out here, because I'm not sure if I have talked long enough, we're going to go through a case study just to be extra sure that this is clear for you. In this case study, I wanted to explore pattern matching and the process of elimination with Bob Moesta. I wanted to share this example that Bob shares in the Harvard Business Review because it demonstrates so profoundly why we should never assume that we have the solution to a customer's problem. Bob was hired to boost sales for new luxury condominiums in Detroit, and the company had targeted downsizers. So retirees looking to move out of the family home or maybe divorced single parents. The units got lots of traffic, but few visits ended up actually converting to sales. The company ultimately had no idea what made people convert to a serious buyer versus someone just kind of casually browsing. Bob conducted research with people who had bought units and asked them to draw a timeline. So the person that he's targeting is people who have already purchased units. Then he digs into their timeline. What he discovered first was that he could rule out the demographics or features of the condo because that didn't indicate any sort of discernible pattern. And then in Bob's conversations with the actual buyers, what he did discover as a pattern was that people kept mentioning their dining room table. So people said, as soon as I figured out what to do with my dining room table, then I was free to move. And Bob actually realized that the real issue that people were having with this was the anxiety that people had to confront when giving up something like a dining room table, which had profound meaning for their family. So Bob says, I went in thinking we were in the business of new home construction, he recalls, but I realized that we were in the business of moving lives. The research discoveries here resulted in new solutions and changes to the offering. For example, the architect created space in the units for a dining room table by reducing the size of the second bedroom. Another brilliant thing they did was the company also provided moving storage for two years worth of storage and a sorting room within the condo development where new owners could take their time making decisions about what they wanted to discard. So there was obviously solutions here around that emotional component. A deep understanding of the customer and the job that they were hired for allowed the company to create innovative solutions and even increase profit. So the company raised prices by $3,500, which included profitably covering the cost of moving and storage. The market was plummeting during that time, but the developers had actually grown their business by 25% through these research discoveries using the JTBD method. That's essentially what I wanted to share with you today. The last thing is just a quick FAQ for questions that I frequently receive. Does this apply to B2C and B2B? Yes, it does. And you'll consider which profiles you need to interview. Is this a replacement for personas? No, it's not the same thing as personas. If you want to read more on that, I believe Nielsen Norman Group has an article. Is the end user always the person that you're solving the problem for? No, they're not. That's something that we mentioned earlier. You want to consider who the actual task is being solved for. And how many people should I do qualitative interviews with? Well, the answer always is going to be it depends without any context, but generally try aiming for 10 to 20 people. What companies use JTBD? Well, it became popularized by companies like Intercom, Basecamp, Twitter, Apple, and basically many companies with origins based in the San Francisco Bay Area use this method. You could say there's a lot of people who don't even realize that they're using JTBD, but it's just sort of an ingrained part either of design thinking or maybe product development processes. JTBD is nothing too crazy from what a lot of product teams are doing already in the Bay Area. Last things, I would love it so much if you would rate this podcast, if you are enjoying it and gaining value from it. And also, if you rate it, you can send me a screenshot of your rating, and I'll send you a PDF on growth. I'm also working on a free mini course, which I can share with you. Other than that, if you want the resources, make sure you get the Conscious Design newsletter, which is linked in the show notes. And I will see you in the next episode. If you have any feedback for me, again, you can reach me at sarahtajimaatsubstack.com. Thanks so much, and I'll see you in the next episode.
