Oh, hey, it's your podcast stepdad who smells like garlic, but is so happy you made it to this update because it's just such a comfy, cozy catch up with an all-time favorite guest. So trees, trees, trees. If you have not yet listened to the full episode, you just beep, beep, beep. Back it up, kiddo. Hit that first. I promise you there's an order. It makes sense. Also, since you made it here, I promised an update on the unnamed tree that I mentioned in the 2018 interview. And does it have a name? It's been two years and it doesn't. No, it does not have one. Nothing is sacred. I'm mad at everything. I'm really pissed on one hand that it is nameless, but also on the other hand, I'm kind of relieved and I feel calm in my heart that it's not named after Pepsi Max or like T-Mobile, like Tree Mobile. Oh, God, just please, Earth, swallow me. Okay, so more updates on the life and times and adventures of your favorite dendrologist, including whether or not he calls himself a dendrologist. Casey, clap. How are you? Hi, Allie. I'm just doing so great. How are you? Good. It's so good to hear your voice. You as well, although I've heard it 100,000 times now. My God. I feel like after ... I mean, I just was listening to dendrology this morning, so I feel like we just hung out this morning. Well, that sounds great. Hang out in the morning, hang out at night. I'm drinking a beer right now, so we're all on the same page. Oh, it's so good to have you back. Are you aware that your episode on dendrology is maybe a fan favorite of all of the 200 episodes I've done? No, I didn't realize it until recently. And I'm like, it's so stunning to me. I'm so happy to be a part of this. Yeah, no, honestly, when people recommend episodes to each other, it's like, oh, you got to start with dendrology. That tree guy's amazing. People love you. Oh man, well, I love them too. So it's very neutralistic here. Now, it's winter right now, almost. We're going into winter. Yes, we're nearly at the solstice. Yeah, we're almost there. We've got four days. Now, anything new about trees that you have perhaps learned in the last year and a half? Anything that has recently come into your world that you felt like you wanted to share? Any new tattoos? Oh my God, I got so many more tattoos. I was actually thinking about that because I was like, oh my gosh, I've added to my armoretum, is what I call it. Armoretum. It's good. That's how many trees. It's become more than just one. It's a collection now. Which ones do you have? What'd you get? Let's see. So I have a bristlecone pine tree tattooed on my chest. And that takes up almost a quadrant. I got a Douglas fir cone with a bunch of little mushrooms that come out. This is a fun thing. I learned this. So there is a fungus and it's Strobiformis trulisatus, I believe is the scientific name. It doesn't have a common name. It's a fungus that only colonizes and grows on the cones of the Douglas fir tree. That's it. So quite specialized. I was like, oh, I really want to get a fungus, a mushroom tattoo, but I don't want it to be one of those almost kitschy mushrooms. Everyone gets that. I was like, no, it's got to be a little bit more original. So I found this mushroom when I was just looking through the world. You can find it if you go out to the forest. You'll see it right now. I was like, that's adorable. So I took it to my artist and he drew it up and he's like, yeah, what do you think? I was like, it's perfect. Let's do it. So I got these little mushrooms popping out of a little Douglas fir cone. And then I have an enlarged larch cone that is right on the top side of my wrist. And then the Carolina hemlock, the sub alpine fir. I think that's it. I think those are only the new tree related tattoos. How do you pick, by the way, of all those species? The bristlecone pine, for example, what was it about that tree that inspired you to get a massive chest piece? Oh my God. Have you seen those trees? Yes. All you got to do is go look at them and then all inspiration done. So the bristlecone pine is that dense gnarled ancient tree that one Don Curry cut down while doing research only to find that that specimen was the oldest known living thing on planet Earth at the time until he killed it. So loops. But these Western U.S. conifers, they look kind of like if a lightning bolt was made out of driftwood. It's just gnar gnar in every way. I went down and saw them. It was just absolutely blown away. And I think that they are the most uniquely beautiful trees, you know, because you can see them and they look old and, you know, they're tiny trees comparatively, like you could fit an entire one of these trees inside of a medium sized sequoia. But it is. But they're like literally twice as old. So there's just the I don't know, you just I could stare at it the way someone can stare at water or stare at fire, you know, like it just kind of captivates you. So that's that was the inspiration. I was like, I got to get something like that tattooed. And I really want to take up this massive space that I have. So what am I going to do? And I gave it to the the artist who I work with. And I was like, hey, man, I just this is kind of my idea. And he drew a couple things up. And he was he had his iPad and he was looking at it while he was tattooing me. And so it wasn't like a drawing that he put on me. He's kind of like, all right, this is kind of the idea. I'm going to make it better as we do it. And he was actively like judging the tree that he was looking at and then putting it on me at the same time. I was like, this is excellent. I love this. And when something is tattooed into your actual flesh, it really is a portable evergreen. It's a forever green. Oh, on the topic of life.And Winter, Casey shared some dendrological myths and lore. I did some research on this with one of my friends and it is actually such an interesting like Christianization almost of pagan holidays. And basically the idea is that there's always been sort of pagan holidays over the solstice. And the fun thing that I learned is that, and I don't know what exact tradition this is, if it was, you know, Gauls or Celts or something like that, but there was a holly king and there was an oak king. The oak king was the king over the summertime. As soon as the winter solstice happens, when the days immediately start getting longer, the oak king's power would kind of grow and he'd get more and more strength and he'd kind of, the power of the holly king would kind of wane a little bit or wax. Which ones go away and which ones come? I think waning is going away. Waning, it's fading. So the holly king was waning while the oak king was waxing. And then at the summer solstice, the oak king's at the height of its power and glory when you have the biggest oak trees and they have all their leaves and they're so divine in a lot of different cultures. And then as soon as the summer solstice in June 21st comes around, then all of a sudden its power starts fading. And then the holly king starts coming back and the holly is obviously evergreen. At least it was the one that they're talking about, the English holly or the sort of common holly over in Europe. That tree then started getting along with the more power, the more power. And then all of a sudden, you know, you have that sort of power dynamic that comes and goes. And on the solstice, they would bring in these evergreen things as a celebration of everlasting life and that kind of thing. There's a branch. So I just thought that was the most fascinating thing where everyone, like it was just this, you know, you were connected to the land, you were celebrating, you know, the turning of the days, getting longer, getting shorter. And then all of a sudden, you know, they took it and as religions and cultures change, they kind of took that same idea and transformed it to a new tradition. As we look at it now, obviously the tradition's very much different than it was 3000 years ago. Now, what about Arbor Day? Do you celebrate? I love Arbor Day. One of my professors when I was at the University of Massachusetts, he would always, he had a really thick Boston accent and he was like, I can't even do the accent. I was going to try and then I panicked and I stopped. Maybe that'll come out some other time. But he would always say, all right, it's the most holy day of the year, Arbor Day, go outside, go plant a tree. And he's just, I thought that was the funniest thing because I had no idea what he was talking about. And he's like, hey, most holy day of the year is coming up. I'm like, what? It's like, it's April. What are you talking about? Like Arbor Day. Arbor Day, go to the park. Yeah, go to the park, plant a tree. All right, guy. He was kicking the pants, that guy. Now, what about, since we talked last, you demurred when I called you a dendrologist saying that you were more of an arborist. Do you feel like you are still more of an arborist than a dendrologist? Has your, any thoughts changed? I'm going to say a little bit, yes. And I think honestly, I have to admit where once you said it and you know, like someone starts calling you something, it's like, oh, okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I am. I never, I guess I never gave myself that title, but if everyone else will, I guess I'm just going to live into it. I'm going to, I'm going to take it. Oh good. That makes me so, so happy. Well, thank you. What about, what are you looking forward to in 2021? In 2021, actually, I have a very specific thing that I'm looking forward to and it's kind of a thing that I have to drop right now, I guess, is that I am officially actually trying to make a podcast and we're making a podcast. My friend Alex Croson and I, it's going to come out on the 7th of January. So right as 2021 starts. Oh my gosh, what's it called? It's called Completely Arbitrary. Yeah. I'm so happy that you laughed at that. Yes. Of course. What's the first episode about? Okay. So the first episode is actually about the Douglas fir, I believe is what the first one is going to be. We have a couple that we have lined up. And so we just decided that we are going to make it about the Douglas fir. And the whole scheme, when I pitched this to my friend Alex, I was like, Alex, okay, so you don't know much about trees. And he's like, yeah, I know you know a lot about trees. I'm like, yeah, you know, okay, I do. But so what if, what if between you and I, we just got to get together and we just kind of talk about trees and then we give them a rating. We, we review trees as if they were, you know, a material item that someone could be like, oh, oh, tell me about it. Like, I'm going to scroll down on the Amazon list of trees and then see all the different consumer reviews of it. That is basically what we're going to do. We're going to introduce a tree. I'm going to talk about it and say, all right, so here's the facts, just the facts, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he's going to look at me and be like, the tree's green. It's got leaves. And that's about all I know. Oh, okay. Y'all heard it here first. Completely arbitrary. Get it? Okay. So it officially launches on January 7th, but I strongly begged Casey to put up an episode zero trailer so you can find it now and subscribe wherever you get podcasts. This is breaking news people. I am the TMZ of tree gossip. But he is a, just a delight to talk to. We've been friends for just years, probably decades by this point. And at the end of it, we're going to give a rating out of, I think, what did we decide? 10 golden cones of honor. It came out just randomly when we were sitting there. And then afterwards, we're going to take a question that someone gives us and we're going to answer it. So if someone's like, hey, what is a ectomycorrhizal fungi? Then we're going to talk about that. So that's the plan. And it's going to be like 30 minutes. You're on your bike, you're riding to work, you're on the bus, you're driving. Put on 30 minutes, listen to Casey and Alex talk about trees, laugh a little bit, cry a little bit. Mostly because I probably am going to rate some trees that people really like pretty severely. I was going to say there's got to be trees on your shit list. Well, I don't know if you recall me talking about apple trees.Oh yes, I remember. There are some shitless trees and they're going to come out. We don't know when, we've got to pepper them in there every now and then. We want to keep the vibe high so everyone's like, oh, this is a nice positive podcast. But then every now and then it's probably going to be like, oh, we're going to be talking about the Myrobian plum. I'm like, oh my god, don't even get me started. Oh my god, you're going to spill the tree on it. Yeah, it's going to be pretty rough. Oh, I'm so excited. That comes out January 7th. On the 7th, January 7th. So that's completely arbitrary? Oh, it is completely arbitrary, trust me. But it's also called completely arbitrary. I'm so excited. But specifically, because we're doing this over the radio, it's A-R-B-O-R-trary. I had a feeling. I had a feeling. As we were discussing, I was like, you know what, Alex, I don't think we should make a pun name. And then why don't we make it a punny name? Of course, you have to. Is the podcast art just going to be a bunch of your tattoos? You know, it might as well be, but I think it's going to be a cone. We're just getting that figured out and solidifying that. We just got some of the artwork put in today. I think it's going to be a cone and then kind of a thing on top that says completely arbitrary, kind of arced over it. Oh, that's amazing. I'm so excited. Okay, really quick break to hear about sponsors of the show, and they make it possible for us to make a donation in Casey's name. This week, it goes to Ecotrust.org, which is a Portland, Oregon-based nonprofit working with indigenous nations and private and public landowners to transition to climate-smart management. And Ecotrust is firm in their beliefs that forests hold the greatest potential to mitigate the effects of global warming. So you will hear about sponsors of the show that made that possible now. Okay, now, if you are looking to cultivate your own armoratum, who is a good gardener for that? Also, do you want to shout out your tattoo artist? Oh, yeah, his name's Sean Hebrink with a blood root tattoo here in Portland. Cool. He is such a delight. Just one of the nicest people I've ever met. Just an incredible artist. Does he like trees more since working on you? I wouldn't say more, but what I really dig, and why I've kept going back to him now several times, is that each time I give him a thing, like, hey, I want this, and then I'm very specific. I'm like, no, no, this is a fir cone, or this is a this kind of cone, or this is a that kind of cone, rather than a pine cone. Maybe that's a myth I should break, is that everyone will always say, oh, I love that doug fir pine cone. It's like, no, that's a doug fir cone because it's not a pine, you see? It's one of those things where you learn, and then you for 30 seconds start calling people out. Then you realize that you're trying to stop a tide, and you're like, oh, just let it go. It's not that important. Whenever I give things to him, I'm like, hey, Sean, I have this very specific thing with this very specific purpose, with these very specific biological or whatever meanings. He picks up on it and finds it to a T, and then knows it. I told him about this fungus, and then he looked it up himself, so he was making sure that he was drawing it right. When he posted it on his social media, he called out the fungus by the scientific name, and all these things. It was like, you're the best. He takes it, I guess, personally, and then really gives it a good piece of art because he knows exactly that I'm not looking for just like, oh, I want a pine cone. He's like, no, I'm getting a Carolina hemlock cone. It looks exactly like this. Don't just randomly look up hemlock cone or find some other random stuff. When something is on someone's body until they die, that's a lot of responsibility. You don't want to be the no regrets tattoo of trees. Exactly. I agree. I have to think about that whenever I see everyone else's tattoos, and I judge them. Not judging like, is that good or bad, but I'm like, okay, I know that that's a ponderosa pine, but that's a hemp? Those are not pine needles. What are those? I've seen tattoos like, okay, let me give you an example. Things that are in the lily family, lily ACA, they are defined more or less, I'm going to say more, by having things in parts of three. Every lily that you've ever seen or anything in the lily family will have three petals, three sepals, or six or nine or 12. It's always in multiples of three. These things come in three. I saw this. This was like some random book years and years ago, where it was clearly a lily, like one of those big lily flowers that you can get from half the stores when they're in bloom. It only had five petals. I was like, uh-oh, someone didn't do their research. The more permanent it is, honestly, the worse. Exactly. Well, my first tattoo, I don't know if I told you this, it's a backwards music note. Oh, man. Buckle up, because you're about to love this guy even more. Did I tell you this? No, no. Oh, my God. My very first tattoo, I think I was a freshman in college, and I was like, I want to go get a tattoo. It's going to be great. Cool. I'm cool. Then I went to get it, and I was like, all right, I just want this music note. I think it's a quarter note. It's a music note, one that comes up and then goes over and then goes back down. So I put it on, and I was looking in the mirror, and I was like, oh, man, no, it's backwards. We got to flip that around. The tattoo artist was like, all right, yeah, cool, let's flip it around. So we flipped it around. We tattooed on me. I was super stoked, and I went over, and I was showing my friends, and all my friends were like, oh, you got a tattoo, Casey. Wow, that's great. And then a week later, they couldn't bring themselves to tell me, and we were all like, you know, sitting around, hanging out at one of my friends' apartments, and they're like, Casey, your tattoo's backwards. And like all at once, just kind of shouted it out. I was like, what? And then for the first time, I actually, instead of looking in the mirror, I looked down at my own chest, and I was like, oh, my God, it is backwards. And that's been a thing. My friend, another friend, was like, you know what, just get all your tattoos backwards now.Who cares? Did you ever correct it? No, no. I think if I had to correct it, it would get like three times as big because I'd have to get like the lines for the bar would have to be like big enough to cover the rest of the tattoo. So no, I just have a backwards music note tattooed on me. Oh no. It's a lesson just to leave well enough alone. Exactly. But let me tell you, every time I look at it in the mirror, I'm like, that's a perfect music note. You're like, I got a shitload of backwards cones, but that note is on point. That note is perfect. Yeah, it's exactly, it's exactly, you know, it's a personal tattoo. That's what I realized. Well, the last question I wanted to ask for this refresh is what ology would you really want to hear about? It would be something like I am so fascinated with the like how cities are designed and like what makes them work, what doesn't make them work and obviously I work in a city, so I'm constantly like bombarded with this. But you have like the engineers who are trying to figure out how to make stormwater flow perfectly off the side of this curb, down into this thing. And then there's other people who have to deal with like, all right, well, how, where the streetlights can go. And then they do all these individual things. But the, just the larger planning where everyone's like, okay, we're going to make this city really cool. And here's how, and here's why. That is something I find fascinating. Oh, that's a great one. That's an awesome one. I just recorded one with an urban rodentologist and we talked about sewer rats under Manhattan. That is terrifying. I heard a story where a guy fell into a, uh, like a vault under a Manhattan sidewalk and there were rats, like it was filled with rats. And I was like, that is a literal nightmare. Oh my God. I hope that guy's okay. He couldn't even, yeah, I think he did. Yeah. But he couldn't scream. He was down there for like 45 minutes with rats all around him until they could pull him out because he was like eight feet down and he couldn't scream because a rat would run in his mouth. And it's like, oh my God, I'm shaking right now. You know, I will say that I did an episode with someone who studies like just gratitude and depression and what to do to get yourself kind of out of a funk and smelling trees and like phytochemicals in general for like 20 minutes a day was said to make people a lot happier. And if that might be the secret of your success or like this might be why you're just like the coolest, jolliest person is because you're just in trees all the time. Man, I hope that that's the case. You know what is funny about that? There's a famous arborist or like researcher and his slogan was, um, touch trees. Alex Shigo is his name. And so all of his books, like you open it up and on the very front they say touch trees because he's just like, go out and touch trees. Like people don't do that anymore. So maybe that should be my slogan from now on. It's just smell trees. That's great. I checked today. You have 9,000 Instagram followers. I just hit 9,000 just like three days ago. What did I tell you, dude? I was like, I texted you the day before it went up and I was like, Casey, you get that Instagram up. And you're like, I'm in the middle of the forest. I was like, you get cell service. You put that up. Cause trust me, people are going to want to learn about trees with you. You know, book agents, lit agents, how do they get in touch with you? I guess they DM you on your Instagram. You've become my social media manager just by almost like slapping me in the head and being like, Casey, just go do this. Geez, get it done. So ask charming and knowledgeable people gnarly questions because it'll change the way that you look at those limbs out the window. And plus we're all going to die one day. So you might as well just appreciate things more and ask about them. And you can follow Casey on Instagram at clap4trees as well as his podcast. Both of those are going to be linked in the show notes. His podcast, again, is completely arbitrary. You can already subscribe to the trailer and get the first episode when it drops on January 7th. I think that we should all wear brown pants and a green sweater on January 7th and celebrate. Who's with me? No one? I'm doing it anyway. Okay. So we are at Ologies on Instagram and Twitter. I'm at Allie Ward with one L on both. And you can be a patron at patreon.com slash ologies. We have so many good episodes coming up. You can submit questions for. Ologies merch, including masks, which I know you're already wearing, is available at ologiesmerch.com. And thank you, Shannon Feltes and Bonnie Dutch of the comedy podcast, You Are That, for managing the merch. Thank you, Aaron Talbert and Emily White, Kayla Patton, Noelle Dilworth, who all make the show possible with their very hard work, as well as assistant editor and full-time hottie, Jared Sleeper, and Treven Ray Morris, aka Steven, who hosts the per cast and See Jurassic Right. Nick Thorburn wrote the theme music. And if you stick around to the end of the episode, you know I tell you a secret. And this one is that sometimes when walnuts go bad, they taste kind of like if you ate paint. But I kind of like them that way because it reminds me of moving into a new place and having fresh adventures and getting to put your stuff in cabinets and stuff. Anyway, I think this means that the walnuts are rancid, but I haven't died yet, so it's going fine. All right. See you back next week. We'll have full brand new episodes all for 2021. Meanwhile, I'm just going to be on the couch eating Stroopwafels and bawling to the new Pixar film. Also, COVID is still very much a thing. So let's all stay in for New Year's, shall we? Yeah? Okay, great. Touch some trees, have some bark. Bye-bye. Psychology, nephology, seriology, psychology. Please clap. For trees.
